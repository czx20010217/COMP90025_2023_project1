This zip file contains the following:
1. project1.txt: the project specification
2. Makefile: the file containing instructions for compiling the code
3. PQ-Dijkstra.c: the skeleton to modify.
4. patch.diff: a file describing the changes between
               this version of PQ-Dijkstra.c and
	       the version in the previous .zip file.
	       If you have already modified the old skeleton,
	       you can apply the patch to your code using the command
	           patch < patch.diff
	       (Make a copy of your PQ-Dijkstra.c first, in case this fails.)
5. grid*.txt: sample inputs
